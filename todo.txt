add a limit of 60fps to prevent good devices from having fast animations (or add delta like rocketer)
remember to add numberOfObjectsDrawn to all the drawing functions

Why does client need to disconnect and reconnect if it dies and respawn in same server? (check returntohomescreen function)

change clientfovmultiplier to fov?
check if can reduce mobile mouse movement setinterval from every 30ms to 60ms
CHANGE PVE requestanimframe to requestInterval

traps should render below tank e.g. for shrapnel
remove stars
barricade tank looks weird
barrel length slowly returns to normal after shoot e.g. alpha, and delay reduces even when not holding down mouse
***balance body upgrades barrel damage (and do same things as body damage)
** add maximum amt of skill points
** fix barrel length when lag
*****make cavern use shape spawning function same as other gamemodes, rename cavern to abyss, add mishappen shapes, fix for all other gamemodes
make shape hit color change faster in PvE (make pve use same renderpolygon function as ffa)
**make health bars, chats, and names render above everything else
drones should have rounded edges
on the upgrade button, scrap and shrapnel have sharp edges for trap barrels
*upgrading max health stats should not change health percentage, and change stats to make it more similar to scenexe (and move fov to the body upgrades side)
add settings
add quickchat mobile button
change all bullet flash to the psbc

**PVE change square rendering (hitbox is outside square, not inside) and increase square width from 35 to 50
**apply pve shape collision physics to ffa
Monday: fix all rendering + add map hitbox border (lime green) + fix player and shape collision + fix traps (render square inside hitbox, and increase trap size, remove space between traps)
