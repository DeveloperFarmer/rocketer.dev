Next update: copy homescreen code from rocketer, add settings (add option to turn off health bars when max health, add option to change debug text color to #ccc)
ADD BODY COLLISION, and make sure to this.healingValue = 0;//reset the healing delay time
make bigger shapes rarer, and add special shapes, e.g. gem
add funny mode where shapes rotate super fast
add a limit of 60fps to prevent good devices from having fast animations (or add delta like rocketer)
remember to add numberOfObjectsDrawn to all the drawing functions
